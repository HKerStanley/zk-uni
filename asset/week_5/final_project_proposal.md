# zkStratego

zkStratego is a revamped version of traditional Stratego board game powered by zero knowledge proof.

## Overview

Stratego is a strategy board game for two players on a board of 10Ã—10 squares. Each player controls 40 pieces representing individual officer and soldier ranks in an army. The pieces have Napoleonic insignia. The objective of the game is to find and capture the opponent's Flag, or to capture so many enemy pieces that the opponent cannot make any further moves. (Wikipedia) One core gameplay in the traditional version is when 2 pieces encounter, both are revealed to make sure the encounter result is valid. With the use of zero knowledge proof the reveal can be unnecessary. I think this can make the game more exciting as both players will gain less information in the game so they have to put more thought on speculating opponents setup.

## Use Cases

1. Game is great at onboarding new users and testing new technology. Using zero knowledge to improve a popular traditional board game can introduce zero knowledge and blockchain to an existing group of players from the original game.

2. This game also introduce a technical approach of PvP game, while I hope this can be inspiring or as an example for other PvP game in zero knowledge field.

## Competitive Analysis

There are not many zero knowledge powered games on market. The most famous one is Dark Forest which I dont see much similarity to mine. However, there are existing variance to the original Stratego game like [Luzhanqi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzhanqi) which requires a thrid person as the judge so to prevent the reveal of both pieces. But such approach introduce certain level of centralization and expose the chance of collusion. I see the niche of zkStratego from the existing market.

## Roadmap

The first release of the game will be with exactly the same gameplay and feature as the original game, except the encounter and reveal part. Later on I would like to introduce more features and migrate existing gameplay on chain or improve privacy with zero knowledge proof.
