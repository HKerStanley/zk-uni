# zkStratego

zkStratego is a revamped version of traditional Stratego board game powered by zero knowledge proof.

## Overview

Stratego is a strategy board game for two players on a board of 10Ã—10 squares. Each player controls 40 pieces representing individual officer and soldier ranks in an army. The pieces have Napoleonic insignia. The objective of the game is to find and capture the opponent's Flag, or to capture so many enemy pieces that the opponent cannot make any further moves. (Wikipedia) One core gameplay in the traditional version is when 2 pieces encounter, both are revealed to make sure the encounter result is valid. With the use of zero knowledge proof the reveal can be unnecessary. I think this can make the game more exciting as both players will gain less information in the game so they have to put more thought on speculating opponents setup.
