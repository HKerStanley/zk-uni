## Question 1: Interoperability trilemma

1.  Trustlessness - The security of the interop protocol is equal to the underlying domains.
    Extensibility - The design of the interop protocol can be extended and supported on any domain.
    Generalizeability - The design of the interop protocol is generalized, meaning that it is capable to handle arbitrary cross-domain data.

    For example, the Connext protocol choose to focus on trustlessness and extensibility as a locally verified protocol.

2.  The Connext protocol is trying to improve their generalizeability by making their locally verified NEXTP protocol act like a base layer. In such design users and developers can use this consistent interface across any domain, and generalize the solution by plugging in natively verified protocols on top of NXTP, just like a layer 2 of their NXTP protocol.
